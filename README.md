# Linked Lists ADT

### Description:
As a part of one of the courses I took, 
we were tasked to think of an ADT which will allow the following:

|    Function    |    Order     | Description                             |
| :------------- | :----------: | :-------------------------------------- |
|  `init()`      | `O(1)`       | Initialize a new empty ADT.             |
| `insert(int)`  | `O(n)`       | Inserts the given value into the ADT.   |
|  `deleteMin()` | `O(1)`       | Delete the minimum value of the ADT.    |
|  `deleteMax()` | `O(1)`       | Delete the maximum value of the ADT.    | 
|   `dequeue()`  | `O(1)`       | Delete the oldest value.                |

While trying to come up with a solution to this task
I thought to myself "Why not try to actually implement it?" and so I did.
